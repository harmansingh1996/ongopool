# OnGoPool - Local Deployment Guide for Mac

## Overview
OnGoPool is a complete carpool application that can be deployed locally on your Mac without needing internet hosting. This guide walks you through running the app locally for personal use or development.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js
- **Modern browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
*Note: The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is required due to React-Leaflet version compatibility.*

### 2. Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Local Deployment Options

#### Option A: Using a Simple HTTP Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Install a simple HTTP server globally
npm install -g http-server

# Navigate to the built application
cd dist

# Serve the app locally
http-server -p 3000 -o
```

Your app will open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`

#### Option B: Using Python (Built into macOS)
```bash
# Navigate to the built application
cd dist

# Python 3 (recommended)
python3 -m http.server 3000

# Or Python 2 (if Python 3 not available)
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

#### Option C: Using Node.js serve package
```bash
# Install serve globally
npm install -g serve

# Serve the built application
serve -s dist -l 3000
```

## File Structure
```
dist/                 # Built application (serve this folder)
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html       # Main entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/          # CSS, JS, and other assets
â””â”€â”€ *.js, *.css      # Application bundles
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 3000 is busy, use a different port:
```bash
http-server -p 8080 -o
# or
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

### Build Issues
If you encounter build problems:
```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run build
```

### Browser Compatibility
- **Recommended**: Chrome or Firefox for best experience
- **Safari**: Fully supported
- **Mobile**: Responsive design works on all mobile browsers

## Development Mode

For development with hot reloading:
```bash
npm run dev
```
*Note: Development mode runs on `http://localhost:5173`*

## Security Notes
